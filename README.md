# LocalChatUDP

"local chat" program that can chat directly with a nearby user. The "local chat" program is implemented using a client/Server model based on UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

The chat is performed between a client and a server.

The server will first start-up and make the user choose a port number. Then the server prints out its IP address and port number.

The client then will start up and create a socket based on the information (IP address and port number) provided by the server.

The client/server is able to communicate with each other in a continuous manner.
